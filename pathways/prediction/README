Five prediction methods are compared in the paper. For each method, the code is either provided here, or the necessary packages are linked below. 

* Neighborhood: Code included

* Random walk with restart: Code included

* DIAMOnD: Code included  

* Inductive Matrix Completion: The code used for IMC is available for download from http://bigdata.ices.utexas.edu/software/inductive-matrix-completion/

* Neural Embeddings: The neural embeddings were generated by applying node2vec to an edgelist of the PPI network. The code to train a node2vec embedding can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec. The output was then used to train a logistic regression model, as can be found on scikitlearn.
